    <h2>Logan Jensen</h2>
    <p>My name is Logan. I'm studying for an applied technology degree in programming and web development. I love to write, read, and play video games on my spare time. I may be a credit union teller now, but I hope to use my knowledge from these courses to share my stories through technology and digital media.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for as long as I can remember, but it took me a while for me to form a testimony of my own. My favorite scripture is 1 Nephi 11:17 when it states, "I know that the Lord loveth his children; nevertheless I know not the meaning of all things." It's comforting to know that even though I do not know the answer to everything, I know that everything the Lord does is because of His love for us.</p2>
    <p>I'm excited to learn more web development. I hope that the stories I tell can inspire people to find courage to seek for happiness and goodness, no matter where they find it.</p3>
