            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p id="left">Have you ever tried learning a new language but can’t seem to answer questions such as, what are the grammar rules? When do I spell it differently? And how am I even supposed to pronounce that? If you are struggling with complex problems such as these, and those quick courses aren’t giving you everything you need, you’ve come to the right place. Teangioma (pronounced tang-iyohma) is the all-in-one guide to helping linguists of all levels with rules needed to learn a new language.  From familiar languages like Spanish, to rather obscure and dying languages such as Irish Gaelic, Teangioma will provide you with the basics you need to breeze through any language course.</p>

            <h2>Turning Complex Simple</h2>
            <p id="right">Is this the first website to provide introductory content for a language? Certainly not. However, Teangioma is, to our knowledge, the first website to provide basics for multiple foreign languages all in one place. We hope you learn something from our site and decide to frequently return for all your linguistic needs!</p>
