                <p id="left">It is important to note that Teangioma does not provide any language learning courses, rather it simply introduces new linguists to the basic building blocks of various languages. These include but are not limited to grammar, spelling, pronunciation, sentence structure and word structure, and other various parts of a language that will be found useful. If you ever feel stuck or confused about a part of a language, Teangioma will likely have what you are looking for. It is also important to note, however, that Teangioma only currently covers Spanish and Gaelic, but there are plans in the future to cover the basics of German, Italian, Norse, French, Welsh, and much more.</p>

                <h2>Many Options</h2>
                <p id="right">Whichever language you are looking to learn more about, all you have to do is click on the respective flag of the country that primarily speaks it. From there, you will be greeted in the selected language and be given various options of what you can do. You will be able to select which language subject you have a question about, and each subject will walk you through the basics that can be found repeated throughout the language. If you ever find yourself not in particular need of any rules and simply want to know the translation of a specific word or phrase, feel free to type it into the translate bar and Teangioma will pull results from established translation programs to produce the correct definition.</p>
