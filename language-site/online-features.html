            <h2>More Features</h2>
            <p id="left">There are plans to introduce a new feature within the translator called Aistrucir (pronounced ash-troo-seer).  Aistrucir will be a translator program exclusive to Teangioma. After inputting a word into the translator, it will run the word through an established program like normal. Once it is translated, however, Aistrucir will read through the word or phrase and pick out the suffixes, prefixes, and other parts of the word or sentence and highlight them for you, teaching you further how to better understand the language you are trying to learn. It will also walk you through each letter to give you a comprehensive way to pronounce it. Aistrucir is still in development, so it will take time before it is ready to use. If you are satisfied with the rest of Teangioma, however, you will be pleased to hear that you have something exciting to look forward too!</p>
