        Introduction |
        Have you ever tried learning a new language but can’t seem to answer questions such as, what are the grammar rules? When do I spell it differently? And how am I even supposed to pronounce that? If you are struggling with complex problems such as these, and those quick courses aren’t giving you everything you need, you’ve come to the right place. Teangioma (pronounced tang-iyohma) is the all-in-one guide to helping linguists of all levels with rules needed to learn a new language.  From familiar languages like Spanish, to rather obscure and dying languages such as Irish Gaelic, Teangioma will provide you with the basics you need to breeze through any language course.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Turning Complex Simple |
        Is this the first website to provide introductory content for a language? Certainly not. However, Teangioma is, to our knowledge, the first website to provide basics for multiple foreign languages all in one place. We hope you learn something from our site and decide to frequently return for all your linguistic needs!

      <h3>Learning Options</h3>
      <p>
        Languages Galore |
        It is important to note that Teangioma does not provide any language learning courses, rather it simply introduces new linguists to the basic building blocks of various languages. These include but are not limited to grammar, spelling, pronunciation, sentence structure and word structure, and other various parts of a language that will be found useful. If you ever feel stuck or confused about a part of a language, Teangioma will likely have what you are looking for. It is also important to note, however, that Teangioma only currently covers Spanish and Gaelic, but there are plans in the future to cover the basics of German, Italian, Norse, French, Welsh, and much more.

      </p>
      <p>
        Many Options |
        Whichever language you are looking to learn more about, all you have to do is click on the respective flag of the country that primarily speaks it. From there, you will be greeted in the selected language and be given various options of what you can do. You will be able to select which language subject you have a question about, and each subject will walk you through the basics that can be found repeated throughout the language. If you ever find yourself not in particular need of any rules and simply want to know the translation of a specific word or phrase, feel free to type it into the translate bar and Teangioma will pull results from established translation programs to produce the correct definition.

      </ul>
      <h3>Online Features</h3>
      <p>
        More Features |
        There are plans to introduce a new feature within the translator called Aistrucir (pronounced ash-troo-seer).  Aistrucir will be a translator program exclusive to Teangioma. After inputting a word into the translator, it will run the word through an established program like normal. Once it is translated, however, Aistrucir will read through the word or phrase and pick out the suffixes, prefixes, and other parts of the word or sentence and highlight them for you, teaching you further how to better understand the language you are trying to learn. It will also walk you through each letter to give you a comprehensive way to pronounce it. Aistrucir is still in development, so it will take time before it is ready to use. If you are satisfied with the rest of Teangioma, however, you will be pleased to hear that you have something exciting to look forward too!
